    Git:It is a open control system(we can't pay money for subscription)and version control system.
    Github:It is a virtual cloud storage.in which we can store,share,retrive,modify,the data.Here group of people do work collaboratve way.
    Generally laptop can not communicate with github ,so we should installed git our local,then git is easily communicate with github.
    We should learn some commands.They are
    git -v= = it will check wheather the git is installed or not in our laptop(local)
    git init = Bringing that git to the our project,which project we  want to push/For git initialization.
    git add . = Bringing that project code into the git/ to add all files which are presented in working directory.
    git commit -m "meaningful msg" = to give the commit/after bringing the code in git we should save(commit) that code .In double quotes we should mention meaningful infor that should be understandable way.
    Still now we are working in local.Now to communicate git with github we should mentioned this below command.
    Before that we should create one repository(folder) in remote(github).
    git remote add origin "Remote repository location"
    In github all folders has one parent(top level),and that's name is main ,we can called this main as a main branch ,previously we have master but now it is changed.
    So to change the branch (master to main),use this command
    git branch -M main
    Now it's time to push the code from our local repo to remote repo ,for that use this
    git push origin main
    git status =Check the status of directory.
    cd "filename" = it will use to going to our requ directory(change the directory)
    ls = list the files(display all files which are presented in our directory)
    cd.. = Move to up level.  
    
    git config--global user.email "pujithagvs12@gmail.com"   
    git config--global user.password "pujitha456"

    git clone "remote repo path" = Cloning the github(remote repo)whole code in our local machine.
    git pull origin main = To pull the specific part of the data/code from remote repo to local repo.
